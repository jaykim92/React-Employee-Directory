# React-Employee-Directory

## Description
React-Employee-Directory does an axios API pull to get a randomized list of employees every time the page does a fresh reload. This app was designed to mimic an employee directory to get a quick glance at who is actively working at the agency and what their contact information is. One can sort by first name in ascending or descending alphabetical order, or begin typing in any part of a specific employee's first name, last name, email address, or phone number. The DOM will refresh upon every new character input.

## Successes and Challenges
The most difficult part of using React for the first time was getting to know the format of all the objects and properties I am working with. It was also difficult to get the filter and sort functions working correctly since we are changes directly to the state that were seemingly irreversible. Creating a new state to make changes to was the fix for that problem. Future work for this problem includes styling and expanded functionality in terms of sorting.
