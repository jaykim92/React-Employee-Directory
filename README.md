## Description
React-Employee-Directory does an axios API pull to get a randomized list of employees every time the page does a fresh reload. This app was designed to mimic an employee directory to get a quick glance at who is actively working at the agency and what their contact information is. A randomized list of employees will be displayed every time the page is refreshed.

## Usage
* Users can sort employee directory by first name in ascending or descending alphabetical order
* Users can also use the search bar to type in any part of a specific employee's first name, last name, email address, or phone number and the DOM will refresh search results upon every new character input
